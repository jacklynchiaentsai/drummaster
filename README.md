**JATs Art of Engineering Common Project - Drum Master**
    
**Game Description:**     
A player has to press a board of four buttons to the rhythm of a song (~30 seconds). A display will show the four buttons, which will light up to the rhythm of Harry Potter Theme Song that plays on a speaker. As different buttons light up on the screen, the player must press the corresponding button on their board, which will also light up when pressed. The player has 3 gaming options: Easy, Medium, and Hard. As the difficulty level increases, the tiles would appear faster and the player will have less time to press each button. If the player does not press the correct button or does not press a button in time, then the game is over. Points will be awarded based on the number of correct hits that the player plays in the game. Inspired by Guitar Hero and Piano Tiles.
